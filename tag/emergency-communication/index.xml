      <description>&lt;p&gt;Effective emergency communication in K-12 schools is vital for maintaining safety and ensuring swift incident response. However, many schools are implementing strict policies that limit smartphone usage to create distraction-free learning environments, combat bullying, and prevent cheating. While these policies are beneficial for education, they pose challenges during emergencies when cell phones may not be accessible. Additionally, many teachers do not keep their cell phones near when instructing classes and weather events or infrastructure issues can disrupt cellular networks, making it essential for schools to consider multi-channel communication options even when cell phones are permitted.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
