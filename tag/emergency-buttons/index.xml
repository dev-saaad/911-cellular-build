      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hospital safety isn’t something the average person thinks about. Hospitals are where we go for emergencies, surgeries, births, and general ailments. As a patient of hospitals, we think of the staff as our care providers. What most people don’t know is that between 2011 and 2013, nearly 75% of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/healthcare/workplace-violence-healthcare-underreported-and-often-ignored&#34;&gt;workplace assaults&lt;/a&gt; took place in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/finance/violence-cost-hospitals-2-7b-2016-aha-report-finds&#34;&gt;healthcare settings&lt;/a&gt;. While we are getting treated for our health issues, the staff in our hospitals are getting assaulted by their patients or the patient’s family members/friends. This is a very serious issue, and one that we don’t hear about often enough.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
