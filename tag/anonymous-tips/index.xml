      <description>&lt;p&gt;Penn State University and other higher education institutions are trying to find ways to encourage students to report hazing tips. For Penn State, this comes after the tragic death of 19 year old Timothy Piazza, who died during a hazing incident at Beta Theta Pi’s pledge acceptance party in February of 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;20 months later Pennsylvania now has some of the strictest hazing laws in the country after Governor Tom Wolf’s signing of the ‘Timothy J. Piazza Anti-Hazing law’. The new law will strengthen penalties for hazing while also providing safeguards for protecting students. The increased penalties can include felony charges, while those who call police during a hazing incident will receive immunity from prosecution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
