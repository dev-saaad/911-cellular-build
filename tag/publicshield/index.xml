      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are so many safety solutions for cities that are not always well known to the public, and we’d like to help share some information to keep you safe in your hometown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Keeping a city safe is like building a house. It needs to start with a good foundation, then it requires a lot of work and the proper tools. You can’t build a house with just a hammer, no matter how good that hammer is. We offer tools that assist police departments and citizens. Safety solutions for cities can come in the form of app systems like ours, where we offer a security system in your pocket. 911Cellular offers &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.911cellular.com/app-systems/&#34;&gt;PublicShield&lt;/a&gt;, which gives you the ability to receive mass notifications from city officials, gives you direct access to police with an app that can send out your exact location to emergency personnel in case of an emergency, and gives you the ability to share tips or suspicious activity (along with pictures or video) anonymously to your police department.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
