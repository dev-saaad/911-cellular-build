      <description>&lt;p&gt;A bipartisan group of House lawmakers has reintroduced the Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care and Social Service Workers Act.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The bill (H.R. 1195) – introduced by Rep. Joe Courtney (D-CT) on Feb. 22 and co-sponsored by four Republicans and three Democrats – directs OSHA to issue a standard requiring employers in the health care and social services industries develop and implement workplace violence prevention plans to protect nurses, physicians, social workers, emergency responders and others. The proposed federal legislation pertains, not only to hospitals, but also to facilities such as Veterans’ Affairs, the Indian Health Service and home-based hospice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
