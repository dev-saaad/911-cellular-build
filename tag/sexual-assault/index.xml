      <description>&lt;p&gt;Gun violence is at an all time high in the United States, and college students today have more reasons to worry about their safety than perhaps any other generation preceding them… but most college students also have to worry about acts of sexual violence such as rape and molestation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Acts of sexual violence in the United States are a lot more common than many would like to believe… especially in colleges. According to a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rainn.org/statistics/campus-sexual-violence&#34;&gt;report by RAINN&lt;/a&gt; (Rape, Abuse &amp;amp; Incest National Network), 11.2% of students experience sexual assault or rape during their college years. This alarming statistic includes both graduate and undergraduate students and is not limited to just women, as men are also susceptible to such acts of violence. Moreover, 4.2% of students are stalked when they start college. Many acts of sexual violence go unreported, so the actual numbers are likely even worse.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Arizona State University is attempting to fight the growing issue of campus sexual violence in a way that counters many other institutions’ reactions to the problem. Instead of only increasing security resources or safety technology, ASU is addressing the problem by proactively engaging and educating its students through CounterAct, a multidisciplinary, campus-wide effort to reduce sexual assault and center healthy sexuality using the arts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The initiative is brought in partnership with ASU’s Herberger Institute for Design and the Arts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, students at University of Maryland – Baltimore County met to share their experiences with sexual assault after a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/bs-md-umbc-lawsuit-20180915-story.html&#34;&gt;class-action sexual assault lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; was filed claiming that UMBC maintains a culture of covering up sexual abuse. Eventually their meeting turned into a march, with over 100 students and followers tagging along and chanting ‘No means no…” as they made their way up the campus administration building to meet with UMBC President Freeman A. Hrabowski III.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>#MeToo, the Silence Breakers, and our Stance on Assault</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Time Magazine recently just made the &amp;ldquo;Silence Breakers&amp;rdquo;; the women (and some men) who came forward to talk about sexual assault or harassment, their people of the Year. This is a significant step in the right direction as far as providing people an outlet to share their stories and feel safer coming forward when they’ve been attacked or assaulted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We talk about the Clery Act often, and we consider ourselves to be be well informed and knowledgable about the Clery Act. It is important for you to know about what the Clery Act is and how it can affect you or your child’s safety on campus. The institution’s police department or security departments are required to maintain a public log of all crimes reported to them, or those of which they are made aware. These public logs should be made available on college websites or by the request of the student or the parent(s) of the student. No student should ever feel afraid to tell campus police or trusted officials about a rape that occurred or an assault that took place. If a movement like #MeToo can make students feel safer and give them the ability to talk about something that happened to them, then we support that movement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
