But perhaps the most beneficial aspect of the 911Cellular solution is its ability to fit within your organization like a glove.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Wildfires &amp; Communication</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Communication during wildfires is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s been a devastating wildfire season so far in 2018. West coast residents have been exposed to 16 major wildfires that have burned more than 300,000 acres. The size of these wildfires are particularly troubling, as are their proximity to inhabited communities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many residents are seeing their homes burn despite taking the recommended precautions (creating defensible space and using non-flammable building materials). In some cases, the flame wall can ignite homes from half a mile away, with embers flying above rivers and roads to set the homes ablaze.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Event Safety Relevant Now More Than Ever</title>
      <link>https://911cellular.com/blog/event-safety/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the World Cup starting this week, most of us are thinking about the matches, festivities and glory. But for those who are tasked with providing event safety, the soccer is likely near the back of their minds. Event safety can be extremely complicated, especially for an event that spans a full month and covers an entire county (in this case, a country that is almost an entire continent). Event safety complications arise from both inside and outside the venues. Especially in soccer, where fans are notorious for their extra-curricular fights (see the movie Green Street Hooligans for more insight).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Safety Solutions for Cities</title>
      <link>https://911cellular.com/blog/safety-solutions-for-cities/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are so many safety solutions for cities that are not always well known to the public, and we’d like to help share some information to keep you safe in your hometown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Keeping a city safe is like building a house. It needs to start with a good foundation, then it requires a lot of work and the proper tools. You can’t build a house with just a hammer, no matter how good that hammer is. We offer tools that assist police departments and citizens. Safety solutions for cities can come in the form of app systems like ours, where we offer a security system in your pocket. 911Cellular offers &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.911cellular.com/app-systems/&#34;&gt;PublicShield&lt;/a&gt;, which gives you the ability to receive mass notifications from city officials, gives you direct access to police with an app that can send out your exact location to emergency personnel in case of an emergency, and gives you the ability to share tips or suspicious activity (along with pictures or video) anonymously to your police department.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Hospitals aren&#39;t safe places for these individuals</title>
      <link>https://911cellular.com/blog/hospital-safety-and-eliminating-workplace-violence/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hospital safety isn’t something the average person thinks about. Hospitals are where we go for emergencies, surgeries, births, and general ailments. As a patient of hospitals, we think of the staff as our care providers. What most people don’t know is that between 2011 and 2013, nearly 75% of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/healthcare/workplace-violence-healthcare-underreported-and-often-ignored&#34;&gt;workplace assaults&lt;/a&gt; took place in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/finance/violence-cost-hospitals-2-7b-2016-aha-report-finds&#34;&gt;healthcare settings&lt;/a&gt;. While we are getting treated for our health issues, the staff in our hospitals are getting assaulted by their patients or the patient’s family members/friends. This is a very serious issue, and one that we don’t hear about often enough.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
