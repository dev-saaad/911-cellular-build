      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, students at University of Maryland – Baltimore County met to share their experiences with sexual assault after a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/bs-md-umbc-lawsuit-20180915-story.html&#34;&gt;class-action sexual assault lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; was filed claiming that UMBC maintains a culture of covering up sexual abuse. Eventually their meeting turned into a march, with over 100 students and followers tagging along and chanting ‘No means no…” as they made their way up the campus administration building to meet with UMBC President Freeman A. Hrabowski III.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
