                <h3>Does the app passively track me?</h3>
                <p>No, the app is specifically designed to only track location after an emergency activation. Even so, users can cancel the alert to immediately cease tracking functionality.</p>
                
                
                <h2>Emergency Slider</h2>
                <h3>What happens if I use the emergency feature from off campus? </h3>
                <p>The app will automatically recognise that you’re not on campus and instead of sending the alert to Campus Safety, the app will generate a 911 call that you can place with an additional tap. </p>
                
                <h3>What information is sent to Campus Safety when I use the slider from on campus?</h3>
                <p>Your current location (if you’ve enabled the app to access location services) and your profile (first name, last name and email address).</p>

                <h3>Does the app track my location after using the Emergency Slider?</h3>
                <p>Yes. You can stop this location tracking by pressing the ‘End Alert’ button.</p>

                

                
                <h2>Anonymous Tips</h2>
                <h3>Is my location information shared with Campus Safety when I submit a tip?</h3>
                <p>Only if you allow location sharing by toggling this option ON. </p>

                <h3>Can I submit a tip even if I’m off campus?</h3>
                <p>Yes, tips can be shared from off campus.</p>
 
                <h3>Can I share a photo and/or video?</h3>
                <p>Yes, as long as you allow the application to access your files, you can upload existing photos/videos or capture a new photo/video in real time.</p>
                

                
                <h2>Friend Watch</h2>
                    
                    <h3>Does Campus Safety see my location when I set a Safety Timer?</h3>
                    <p>Only if you select Campus Safety as a contact when setting up your Safety Timer.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Why am I unable to choose Campus Safety as a contact when setting a Safety Timer?</h3>
                    <p>If you are off campus, the option to select Campus Safety is not available and you need to select from other contacts (friends, family, etc.)</p>
                    
                <h3>What happens when I start a timer?</h3>
                <p>
                    An SMS message, containing a description of your activity and a link to your location, is sent to the contacts you selected.
                     Additionally, if you've selected Campus Safety, you're live location will be shared with Campus Safety along with the duration of your timer. 
                </p>

                <h3>What happens if I don’t cancel a timer before it expires?</h3>
                <p>An SMS alert will be sent to your contacts and (if you've selected Campus Safety) Campus Safety they will be notified that you may be in trouble. </p>
